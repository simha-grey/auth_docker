# auth_docker

As for today (10.11.23) it's an unfinished project and a sandbox. Here I'm trying to implement different kinds of user authentication using Symfony 6.3 and HWIOAuthBundle.
My application is just a primitive login form that provides password-based authentication and social authentication. I did it (Do you remember the "12 Monkeys" movie). In fact not so much work.
The hardest part for me was configuring HWIOAuthBundle in several .yaml filesâ€”a lack of instructions.

My app is containerized. It uses three Docker containers: Nginx, Php-fpm, and PostgreSQL. You will find Dockerfiles in the "docker" directory and Makefile with different helpful commands.
